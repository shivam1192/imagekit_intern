## Functionality.
A basic user registration page in which a user enters the information and you can store this information in a database.
If someone from the same IP address attempts to register more than 3 times in a day,
they should be presented with a captcha (Google Recaptcha). The captcha should be
validated for all subsequent attempts to register for that IP address.
